  default_prompt: "Take approved feature requirements, analyze AGENTS.md and existing architecture, ask only decision-critical questions, define models/entities, method/system contracts, and module boundaries, then write docs/plan.md with checklist traceability. For large features, split execution into docs/plan_01.md, docs/plan_02.md, etc., keep docs/plan.md as index with phase links and a phase checklist, then recommend running $vibe-coder."
