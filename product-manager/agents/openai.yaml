  default_prompt: "Refine the user's feature idea into a precise, non-technical product brief for an existing product. Clarify behavior, boundaries, dependencies/constraints, edge cases, and acceptance criteria. Ask only decision-critical feature questions, keep questions concise, and record explicit assumptions when answers are unavailable. Output a finalized product brief and recommend running $tech-designer with a handoff block."
